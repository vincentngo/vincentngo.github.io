    "bio": "I like to build software and ambitious transportation products. I'm the founder of GoodJourney.io, where my team and I are building the next generation of tools that power ground transportation. Outside of that, I'm a product builder with a background in mobile apps (native and cross-platform), obsessed with making complex systems feel simple and reliable. When I’m not building, I'm usually practicing golf, trying to get a little better each week, and thinking about how technology can make everyday experiences smoother.",
