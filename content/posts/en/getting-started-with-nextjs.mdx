# Getting Started with Next.js 16

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building production-ready web applications. In this guide, we'll explore the key features of Next.js 16.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improved performance and SEO
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
3. **App Router**: Modern routing with React Server Components
4. **Built-in Optimization**: Image optimization, font optimization, and more

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
bun create next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
bun run dev
```

## App Router Basics

The App Router uses a file-system based routing. Here's a simple example:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Server Components vs Client Components

By default, components in the App Router are Server Components. Use the `"use client"` directive when you need client-side interactivity:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 16 brings powerful features that make building modern web applications easier than ever. Start experimenting with it today!
