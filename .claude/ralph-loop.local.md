Implement the homepage UI according to the Homepage Specification and Frontend Design System in the project spec. Build app/[locale]/page.tsx with: Hero/Profile (photo, name, bio, location, social links), Recent Writing (latest MDX posts with title, date, excerpt, hover underline), Tags & Topics (clickable tag filters), and a Language Switcher present on all pages (locales: en, fr, vi, ja, es) that updates the URL prefix and persists the user choice. Follow the cailynyong.xyz-inspired design: clean, minimal, generous whitespace, large readable headings, monochrome base with subtle accent color, soft hover states and micro-transitions, balanced asymmetric spacing. Use Tailwind v4 tokens, shadcn/ui components, and next-themes for dark/light. Must remain 100% compatible with static export and localization routing. Success criteria: homepage renders in all locales, language switcher works, no TypeScript or lint errors, static export succeeds. Do not stop until all success criteria are satisfied.
